# Project: Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The repository consists of:
1) a tidy data set, 
2) a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The script: `run_analysis.R`

The tidy dataset: `tidy_data.txt`
